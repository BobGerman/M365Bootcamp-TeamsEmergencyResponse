# Build an Emergency Response solution with Teams and SharePoint

In this half day workshop, you will learn how to build solutions with Microsoft Teams and Microsoft SharePoint. In the process, you will build a simple Emergency Response Center which could be used to coordinate the response to an emergency such as a natural disaster. This could complement the [Crisis Communication Power App template](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/crisis-communication-a-power-platform-template/), which helps to keep employees informed during a crisis; this solution is for the reponse team themselves.

You will build:

 * A SharePoint communication site for publishing news to the response team and others
 * A tab for coordinating supplies and where they're needed, based on a SharePoint list
 * A tab for viewing problem locations on a map, written in SharePoint Framework and backed by another SharePoint list using Microsoft Graph

This repository contains the entire workshop, including presentation material and step-by-step instructions. To complete the hands-on portion of the lab, you will need:

 * A computer with a web browser and an Internet connection (a phone is too small to successfully construct the solution, though it is usable from a mobile device.)
 * A Microsoft 365 Developer subscription (get one free at [https://aka.ms/M365DeveloperProgram](https://aka.ms/M365DeveloperProgram), or one will be provided for you by the workshop facilitator.)
 * For the coding exercises, you will need to install development tools on your computer:
    * Node Version Manager (optional but recommended to allow switching Node versions)
    * Node.js (SharePoint Framework currently requires version LTS 10.x)
    * A code editor such as Visual Studio Code
