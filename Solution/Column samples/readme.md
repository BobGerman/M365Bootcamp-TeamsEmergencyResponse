--------|---------
Location| Location
Contact| People
Supplies| Choice [ Choices - Food Water Flashlight Pet supplies Medicine ]
Comments| Multi-text

> Tip - For location type columns you cannot format columns in the list view, instead go to column settings of the location field and paste the json.
