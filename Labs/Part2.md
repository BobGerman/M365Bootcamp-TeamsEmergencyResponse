In this exercise, you will create a news site in SharePoint and connect it to the Emergency Response team you set up in Part 1. This exercise is optional - the remaining parts do not depend on it - so you could choose to skip it or come back to it later, and proceed directly to [Part 3](Part3.md)

c. Click Add in the screen which follows, and then Save in the screen after that to save the connector. (NOTE: That last screen with the Save button is from SharePoint, not Teams; this is where Teams applications have a chance to configure their connector. In this case, SharePoint didn't require any configuration.)

## Step 2: Add some news to the SharePoint site

a. Still in the General channel, click the elipsis in the upper right corner 1️⃣ to open the menu and select "Open in SharePoint" 2️⃣.
